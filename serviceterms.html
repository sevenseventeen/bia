				<p>Welcome to the Biasport Automotive Network! We are glad you have decided to join our community, and we look forward to your participation. Before you begin, however, we ask that you review this Membership Agreement and agree to its terms. It is important that you understand both the services we provide as well as your obligations. </p>
				<p>The Biasport Automotive Network consists of Biasport.com, InsideLine.com and AutoObserver.com, and any other Web site that we identify as a part of the Biasport Automotive Network. </p>
				<p>This Membership Agreement is an agreement between you and Biasport.com, Inc. (referred to in this Membership Agreement as "the Biasport Automotive Network," "us," "our" and "we"). This Membership Agreement applies to the various communication and personalization tools and services offered on the Biasport Automotive Network that are part of our "community" (the "Community Services").</p>
				<p>While all of the content on the Biasport Automotive Network is available to all visitors to the Biasport Automotive Network, participation in our Community Services is only available to visitors who sign up as Members by agreeing to be bound by this Membership Agreement. </p>
				<p>Biasport requires that a visitor be not less than 13 years old in order to become a Member. Accordingly, by accepting the terms of this Membership Agreement and signing up as a Member you are representing to us that you meet this age requirement. </p>
				<p>Currently, all Community Services are provided without charge. </p>
				<p>The Community Services include our forums, the most established automotive message boards (the "Forums"), as well as the following tools and services: </p>
				<ul class="list-style">
				<li>Biasport' Answers</li>
				<li>Dealer Ratings &amp; Reviews and Repair Shop Ratings &amp; Reviews</li>
				<li>Consumer Reviews (and Ratings) of Vehicles</li>
				<li>Ideas for Biasport</li>
				<li>comments on our articles and blogs</li>
				</ul><br />
				<ul class="list-style">
				<p>As used in this Membership Agreement: </p>
				<li>"Members" means you (when you have accepted this Membership Agreement) and the other members of the Biasport Automotive Network.</li>
				<li>"MGC" or "Member-Generated Content" means all Member content submitted to us through our Community Services or through other channels, as well as any attachments to those submissions or otherwise provided to us (such as documents, photographs and videos).</li>
				<li>"Hosts" are the individuals who host, moderate or supervise the Community Services on behalf of the Biasport Automotive Network, including our staff who participate in Forums and host our blogs.</li>
				</ul><br />
				<p>You acknowledge and agree that by accepting this Membership Agreement and completing the registration process, you are becoming a member of the Biasport Automotive Network and are agreeing to the following: </p>
				<p><strong>General</strong></p>
				<p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion and at any time, to make changes to this Membership Agreement and our other policies concerning the use of the Community Services. (We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion and at any time, to waive or modify any of the terms of this Membership Agreement as they apply to a specific item of MGC or as they apply to a specific Member, without affecting the application of these terms to any other MGC or Members.) Changes will be effective when made and the updated Membership Agreement (or applicable policy) is posted on the Biasport Automotive Network; provided, however, that no such change shall be applicable to any dispute between you and us that arises prior to the time such change is effective. Accordingly, you should visit this page periodically to review its provisions. As described below, any Member who violates this Membership Agreement may be banned permanently from using some or all of the Community Services. </p>
				<p>If any of provision of this Membership Agreement shall be deemed invalid, void or for any other reason unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the balance of this Membership Agreement. </p>
				<p>Any content submitted by you to us that does not require you to first become a Member &mdash; for example, the submission of a letter to our editors, to our Compliments &amp; Success Stories or to Help, or a submittal directly to our staff of feedback, errors, questions or comments &mdash; is not governed by this Membership Agreement. However, those items are "Visitor-Submitted Content" and are governed by the terms of our Visitor Agreement that applies to Members as well as to all other visitors to the Biasport Automotive Network. We encourage you to review our <a href="/about/visitor-agreement.html">Visitor Agreement</a>, <strong>which shall be considered incorporated in and a part of this Membership Agreement</strong>. (Accordingly, by becoming a Member you are agreeing to be bound by the Visitor Agreement, and accordingly a violation by you of the Visitor Agreement would also constitute a violation of this Membership Agreement.) </p>
				<p><strong>Community Services Advertisements and Communications</strong></p>
				<p>You understand and agree that the Community Services and the pages on which Community Services are provided may include advertisements, and that these advertisements are necessary for us to provide the Community Services. You also understand and agree that we may send you certain communications in connection with the Community Services, such as service announcements and administrative messages, and that you will not be able to opt out of receiving those communications, and that we may send you copies of any periodic newsletters or similar informative communications we send to Members generally (but you will have the opportunity to opt out of receiving future issues at any time). Any communications sent to you personally concerning your participation in the Community Services or related matters are not intended to be made public, and you agree not to post those communications in the Community Services or elsewhere on the Internet. </p>
				<p><strong>Availability of Community Services</strong></p>
				<p>While we make reasonable efforts to ensure that the Community Services are available at all times, we do not guarantee that the Community Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, and we do not guarantee that Members will be able to access or use all the Community Services or all of their features at all times. </p>
				<p>We may change, suspend or discontinue any (or all) Community Services, or any of their features, at any time. We may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain features or portions of the Community Services, or restrict your access to any part or all of the Community Services, in all cases without notice to you or liability to us. </p>
				<p><strong>Member Identification and Use of Registration Data</strong></p>
				<p>As part of the registration process, you must select a username and password. <strong>You agree to register only once using a single username.</strong> The information that you supply during the registration process must be accurate and complete and you agree to not (i) register under the name of another person; (ii) choose a username that constitutes or suggests an impersonation of any other person or entity or that you are a representative of an entity when you are not, or that is offensive; (iii) choose a username for the purposes of deceiving or misleading our visitors and/or the Hosts as to your true identity; or (iv) choose a username that incorporates a solicitation (e.g., yoursitedotcom, dealershipname, isellporsches). </p>
				<p>Your Forums profile is only displayed to other Members. Your email address included in your Forums profile will remain private and will not be displayed, unless you change profile settings to request that it be displayed. </p>
				<p>For more information regarding our privacy policy, please review our <a href="/about/privacy.html">Privacy Statement</a>, which provides that under certain circumstances we may reveal what we know about you. </p>
				<p><strong>Keeping Your Personal Information Private</strong></p>
				<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You are responsible for all usage and activity in the Community Services through your username and password, including use of your username and password by any third party. Your account is unique to you and may not be transferred to any third party. You should <a href="http://support.Biasport.com/contactus.aspx">notify us</a> of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your username and password. </p>
				<p>Members should be aware that disclosure in the Community Services of your full name, street address or other personal information raises safety concerns and may result in solicitations from third parties or unwanted communications. We disclaim any responsibility or liability arising from your disclosure of such personal information, or any other information, in the Community Services. </p>
				<p>Other than the inclusion (at your election) of your email address in your Member Profile, you may not post your email address anywhere in the Community Services, nor may you post your phone number. </p>
				<p><strong>MGC Management</strong></p>
				<p>While we have no obligation to do so, we do monitor certain MGC. However, since not all of the areas that are monitored are done so on a "real time" basis, you may see MGC that violates this Membership Agreement before we do. Please report such items to our Hosts by using the Help link on every page, or the "Report It" link (where available). </p>
				<p>We reserve the right to review all MGC and to remove, or to refuse to display, any MGC in our sole discretion and for any reason. However, we also reserve the right in our sole discretion to display any MGC that is submitted to us (or to decline to remove any MGC), even if it violates this Membership Agreement. </p>
				<p>We do not make any promises as to what actions we will or will not take with respect to any MGC, and no such promises should be inferred from either this Membership Agreement or any communication by us. </p>
				<p>MGC posted by a Member in the Forums may be revised during the 30 minutes after it is posted, but may not be revised or deleted by the Member after that time. MGC posted in Ideas for Biasport may be revised until the  related idea is designated as "It's Alive" or "Not Planned."Â Other MGC, including reviews of vehicles, dealerships and repair shops, and related comments, may not be revised or deleted by Members. </p> 
				<p>You understand that the MGC of the other Members is based on their individual opinion and experience, which may vary significantly from one person to the next. We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of any MGC, and you agree that we are not responsible for the accuracy of the MGC and will not be liable for any damages incurred as a result of the submission or use thereof. </p>
				<p><strong>Member Conduct</strong></p>
				<p>We welcome all points of view on automotive matters. However, although interactions within the Community Services occur in cyberspace, everyday manners apply. Please respect and interact with fellow Members as you would in any public arena. Civility and respect underlie the success of an on-line community; if you wish to take issue with the statements of other Members or the Hosts, please engage in healthy, mature debate and not immature behavior or name-calling. While we want to maintain an inviting environment for all visitors, disruptive conduct, such as off-topic comments in a topic-oriented discussion in the Forums, is not allowed. Neither is "spam" (e.g., posting your message in multiple places throughout the Forums). </p>
				<p>Community Services are areas for the exchange of information and, in some areas, advice. Questions asked may be answered within those areas, but please do not attempt to take the conversation out of the Community Services (such as by requesting that an answer be emailed). Such actions deprive other visitors of the benefit of the Community Services. </p>
				<p>You may not include in any MGC either any email addresses or telephone numbers of any person or entity, including your own. </p>
				<p><em>Profanity, Harassment and Other Inappropriate Conduct</em></p>
				<p>You may not submit MGC that is indecent, profane (including masked profanity where symbols, initials, intentional misspellings or other characters are used to suggest profane language), obscene, pornographic, abusive, threatening, misleading, illegal or defamatory, or any material that interferes with the ability of others to enjoy the Community Services. We wish to maintain a family-friendly, "G-rated" environment. Please use this as your guideline when in doubt. </p>
				<p>You also may not submit MGC that consists of or contains software viruses, political campaigning or commercial solicitation.  You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity (including any other Member or Host), or otherwise mislead as to the origin of your MGC. </p>
				<p>In addition, we do not tolerate Members' harassing, threatening or embarrassing other Members, including harassment or denigration based on age, gender, race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or disability, marital status or veteran status, or the stalking other Members ("cyberstalking"). You agree not to engage in this behavior. </p>
				<p><em>Illegal and Objectionable Activities</em></p>
				<p>We do not allow the promotion of illegal conduct or activities or fraudulent schemes in the Community Services. Specifically, you may not advocate illegal conduct, such as street racing, reckless driving or driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You also agree to not engage in any illegal activity in connection with your participation in or use of the Community Services. </p>
				<p><em>Rights of Third Parties</em></p>
				<p>You may not submit MGC that infringes in any manner on the copyright, trademark or intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or that contain any confidential or proprietary information of any person or entity, or that otherwise violates the legal rights of any person or entity. In certain areas of the Community Services, you may insert hyperlinks in your MGC to permit visitors to access copyrighted materials &mdash; but, except for quotes of reasonable length, you may not post such materials in the Community Services. You may not use the Community Services to distribute unauthorized copyrighted material, including photos, videos, artwork text, recordings, designs or computer programs. </p>
				<p>You may not submit MGC that contain personally identifiable information about other people, such as their phone number, street address or email address, or information about other people that could result in an invasion of their privacy or their harassment.  However, if you are posting a review in Dealer Ratings &amp; Reviews or Repair Shop Ratings &amp; Reviews, a different set of guidelines apply; see below. </p>
				<p>We disclaim any responsibility or liability for copyrighted materials posted in the Community Services. If you believe that your work has been copied in a Community Service in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, please follow the procedures set forth in our Visitor Agreement. </p>
				<p>You may not harvest or collect information about other Members from the Biasport Automotive Network, including usernames, or use that information for the purpose of sending unsolicited bulk communications. You may not use or provide to any person or entity, whether or not for a fee, any directory of or information regarding other Members. </p>
				<p><em>Promotions and Solicitations</em></p>
				<p>You agree that, except with our prior consent, you will not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise use any Community Service to make or distribute any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, contests, sweepstakes, survey requests or promotional materials or implore visitors to take actions that are intended to further a personal purpose. You agree you will not use information supplied within the Community Services to do any of the foregoing, by email or any other method. You agree to not gather public email addresses from Member profiles for any purpose. You agree that your MGC will not promote, link to or encourage others to visit auto Web sites that provide message boards, forums or chats. </p>
				<p>If you are describing, in  Forums, a transaction or dealing with an automobile dealership, you may include the dealership name and its location. However, please do not include in a Forums posting the names of any salespeople or their telephone numbers, email addresses or other contact information. If you are posting a review in Dealer Ratings &amp; Reviews or Repair Shop Ratings &amp; Reviews, a different set of guidelines apply; see below. </p>
				<p>Including a link in MGC to another Web site is permissible when appropriate in the context of answering a question posed by another Member, but not for the purpose of promoting other automotive communities or third-party services or products. The Hosts will remove any link they believe does not provide value to visitors. </p>
				<p>Links included as a part of your signature line are never permitted and will be removed by the Hosts. </p>
				<p><strong>License of MGC to Us</strong></p>
				<p>You agree that, by submitting MGC to the Biasport Automotive Network, you are granting to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable and fully assignable and sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, edit, reformat, create derivative works from, distribute, display and provide to third parties that MGC throughout the world for any purpose and in any media. You are also granting to us the non-exclusive right to seek to enjoin and/or obtain damages from any third party from the unauthorized use or reproduction of your MGC, as well as the right to attribute your MGC to you and you waive any "moral rights" in your MGC. </p>
				<p>You agree that you will not use or reproduce any MGC of any other Member in any manner or in any media, including posting or republishing any MGC of another Member on any other Web site. (You may, however, occasionally reprint or post excerpts, not to exceed 50 words, from a single item of MGC another Member if it is clear that the original and full item of MGC is available within on the Biasport Automotive Network.) You may also display a link to, or the address of, the page of the Biasport Automotive Network on which any MGC appears.</p>
				<p><strong>Ideas for Biasport</strong></p>

				<p>You agree that the Materials you submit: (i) are original with you, and (ii) do not violate and will not violate the rights of any third party or any local, state, national or foreign law, including any right of publicity, right of privacy or any other proprietary right. </p>

				<p><strong>Dealer Reviews &amp; Ratings; Repair Shop Reviews &amp; Ratings</strong></p>
				<p>These areas of our Community Services provide you with an opportunity to describe what your experience was like with a dealership or repair shop &mdash; and to comment on the experience of others. </p>
				<p>To facilitate the free flow of useful information about these businesses, we have established a number of "rules of the road" for posting in these areas. These policies and guidelines are, in some instances, different from those that apply to our other Community Services, and are as follows:</p>
				<ul class="list-style">
				<li>Your review should describe what your experience was like, with facts and not fluff. Stay on-topic. We do not publish reviews that do not provide information about the reviewer's personal experience.</li>
				<li>While we ask that our visitors not post reviews and comments that are defamatory or otherwise inaccurate, and that they refrain from offensive personal descriptions or incivility, we do not we remove a review or comment in response to allegations that it contains defamatory language or inaccuracies, or because it may be offensive to some people.</li>
				<li>While we do permit you to include your description of and frank opinion about your experience, we do not permit "name-calling" or the use of profanity. </li>
				<li>We do not permit the posting of ads or solicitations, HTML or links, or personal contact information (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses) for you or others; or using ALL CAPS. </li>
				<li>You may include the name of any salesperson or other individual with whom you dealt but &mdash; to reiterate &mdash; not his or her telephone number, email address or other contact information.</li>
				<li>Please note that after a review is submitted, it may not be revised or deleted by you &mdash; and we will not do so if requested. However, a reviewer has the ability to supplement a review by posting an update to it.</li>
				<li>A comment can be positive or negative, ask questions and/or provide supporting information. Please note that the  guidelines set forth in this Membership Agreement for the posting of reviews also apply to the posting of  comments.</li>
				</ul><br />
				
				<p>Dealers and repair shops and their representatives have the ability (if a member of the Biasport Automotive Network) to comment on the reviews of their businesses. However, we request that any person associated with the business, either personally or professionally, disclose that relationship in his or her comment. If you represent a dealership or repair shop, please visit our <a href="/dealers/dealer-ratings-and-reviews.html">Dealer Resource Center</a> and download our Information Sheet; it includes tips on how best to engage and benefit from our Dealer Ratings &amp; Reviews. </p>
				<p>We have a policy of not posting a review that we know, or have reason to believe, is not a genuine reflection of a consumer's experience at a dealership or repair shop. We do not, however, remove a review in response to an allegation that it is not genuine unless we are presented with persuasive extrinsic evidence.</p>
				<p>We do not make any promises as to what actions we will or will not take with respect to any review or comment, and no such promises should be inferred from either this Membership Agreement or any communication by us.</p>
				<p>It is a violation of this Membership Agreement for you to create or post, to advise or induce anyone else to create or post, or to participate or assist anyone in the creation or posting of, any review that is not a bona fide reflection of the actual experience of the person submitting that review. Anyone who violates the foregoing prohibition will be subject to legal recourse by Biasport, including claims for damages and/or for indemnification as provided below.</p>
				<p><strong>Consumer Reviews (and Ratings) of Vehicles</strong> </p>
				<p>This area of our Community Services provides you with an opportunity to describe your experience with a particular vehicle &mdash; and to comment on the experience of other reviewers.</p>
				<p>In an effort to provide site visitors with the most valuable consumer insight and information, we have established a number of "rules of the road" for posting in this area. These policies and guidelines are, in some instances, different from those that apply to our other Community Services, and are as follows</p>
				<ul class="list-style">
				<li>Please only write a review if you have spent time driving the vehicle. Your review should contain facts and details of your driving experience.  We do not publish reviews that do not provide specific information about the reviewer's personal experience with the vehicle.</li>
				<li>If you or a member of your household is associated with any automotive manufacturer, dealer or advertising agency, or with a supplier to the automotive industry, you are required to disclose that relationship in your review and in any comment.  </li>
				<li>We do not permit the posting of ads or solicitations, HTML or links, or personal contact information (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses) for you or others; or using ALL CAPS.</li>
				<li>Please note that after a review is submitted, it may not be revised or deleted by you &mdash; and we will not do so if requested. However, a reviewer always has the ability to supplement a review by posting a comment to it</li>
				<li>Please note that the  guidelines set forth in this Membership Agreement for the posting of reviews also apply to the posting of  comments.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />

				<p>You agree not to (i) take any actions that would adversely affect our rights in our Trade Names, or (ii) file any application or other document with any governmental authority to register any corporate name, trade name, trademark, service mark, certification mark, collective mark or other similar designation that includes any of our Trade Names or any confusingly similar names, or (iii) take any other action that is inconsistent with our rights in our Trade Names (or aid or abet any third person in doing so). </p>
				<p><strong>Termination of Membership</strong></p>
				<p>Please be aware that your membership may be revoked if you fail to abide by the terms of this Membership Agreement. In the event this should occur, you agree not to re-register as a Member of the Biasport Automotive Network. Furthermore, you acknowledge that we reserve the right to take action &mdash; technical, legal or otherwise &mdash; to block, nullify or deny your ability to submit MGC. You understand that we may exercise this right in our sole discretion. </p>
				<p>We also reserve the right to disable or terminate a Member's account, without notice, if there is a period of extended inactivity. </p>
				<p>If your membership is terminated or deactivated by us, your MGC may be deleted and your username may be given to another Member without notice to you.</p>
				<p><strong>Community Security; Violations of Law</strong></p>

				<ul class="list-style">

				<li>Use of software that allows your account to stay logged on while you are not actively using the account</li>
				<li>Unauthorized access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without the express authorization of the owner of the system or network</li>
				</ul><br />
				<p>We may investigate incidents involving such violations, any violations of this Membership Agreement that may constitute or have the potential to constitute violations of law, and any activity by Members on the Biasport Automotive Network that constitute or may constitute violations of law. You understand that we may report any such activity to, and cooperate with, law enforcement, with or without receipt by us of a subpoena or other legal process. </p>
				<p><strong>Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
